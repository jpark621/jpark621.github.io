# about me

I am a machine learning engineer at [Forethought.ai](https://www.forethought.ai/). I work on making search faster and more accurate. 

My research interests are natural language understanding, model compression, and algorithms. Currently, I work on efficient methods for machine reading and information retrieval with contextualized word embeddings like ELMo and BERT. I participate in data competitions and research conferences to keep up with the latest ideas.

I did my undergrad in UC Berkeley, where I focused on research, teaching, and community building.
