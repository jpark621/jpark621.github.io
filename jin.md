# jin, a deadwood technique

Jin (ç¥ž) is a bonsai deadwood technique used on branches or the top of the trunk (the "leader").[2] A jin is meant to show age, or show that the tree has had a struggle to survive. Jins are created in nature when wind, lightning, or other adversity kills the leader or a branch further down the tree.[3] A jin requires the complete removal of bark from a given start point to the end of the branch or leader. The remaining wood dies and dries out to form the jin.[4] ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_bonsai_techniques#Jin))
